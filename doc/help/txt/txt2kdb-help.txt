 txt2kdb [Options] FILE KCOLUMN
    Create a KColumn physical column out of a text file.

    FILE:
        The text file should be ASCII or UTF-8 using LF, CR or CR-LF
        line termination.  Each text line will be put into the
        KColumn as a separate Row.  Each Row will be in its own
        blob.
    KCOLUMN:
        The KColumn is either an existing KColumn or a path to one
        that can be created.    Both paths should be relative to the current directory or full
    from root "/"

Options:
  -b, --begin=START         include only lines starting from this line in the
                            KColumn.  The first line is line 1 (not 0).
  -e, --end=STOP            stop including lines after this line in the
                            KColumn.  The first line is line 1 (not 0).
  -f, --force               (no parameter) this will cause to over-write
                            existing files.  Without
                            this option the program will fail if the KColumn
                            already exists and append mode is not selected
  -a, --append              (no parameter) this will cause to append the text
                            file to an existing KColumn.  If the file does not
                            already exist it will be created.
  -V, --version             this will cause the program to emit the internal
                            version number before any other action
  -v, --verbose             extra information will be output during
                            processing second occurrence on the command line
                            means even more
  -h, -?, --help            print this message
  -l, --log-level=LEVEL     the next token will affect the logging level of
                            the program  accepted tokens are the numbers
                            0-15, fatal, sys, int, err, warn, info
