/* MakeKCacheTeeFile_v3
 *  takes a KFile as source
 *
 *  "tee" [ OUT ] - return parameter for tee file
 *
 *  "source" [ IN ] - the source file, generally costly to read which is
 *  the motivation behind caching its output
 *
 *  "page_size" [ IN ] - the cache-file page size
 *                       ( if 0 ... default-value will be 32k )
 *
 *  "cluster_factor" [ IN ] - a blocking factor for accessing "source"
 *  reads are in blocks of size "page_size" * "cluster_factor".
 *
 *  "ram_pages" [ IN ] - a requested number of pages to be held
 *  in RAM cache.
 *
 *  "path" [ IN ] and "args" [ IN ] - NUL terminated string in directory-native
 *  character set denoting full cache file, i.e. the name of the file
 *  as it would appear after promoting from partial to full status.
 *  a NULL or empty path indicates NO FILE CACHING, but perform RAM caching.
 *
 * the function creates a new ( cached ) KFile in "tee"
 *
 * the caller can access this file to read and query the filesize, these are the only
 * supported messages to this object
 *
 * when the caller requests data that is not already cached in the local file,
 * the cached file will read from the remote-file, write into the local-file and then
 * return the requested data in the read-buffer
 *
 * when the caller requests data that is already cached, the data will be read from
 * the local file only, no remote request will be made
 *
 * when the caller requests data this is partially cached, the file will return the
 * part that comes first either from the remote or from the local file
 * in this case the file will return less data than requested
 *
 * when the caller opens an existing local file that contains a full copy of the
 * remote file, the local KFile will be returned in self
 *
 * this function will check if the remote-file and the local file ( if it already exists )
 * do have the same size and blocksize
