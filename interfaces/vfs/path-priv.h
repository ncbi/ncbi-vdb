 * The ABNF form described in RFC5234 will be used to define URLS and paths
 * with some handwaving instead of complete character definitions for case 
 * insensitivity.  CORE definitions from RFC5234 will be used again handwaving
 * case insensitivity.
 *
 * --------------------
 *
 * URL for a VPath
 *
 *  as per RFC 3986, an URI consists of:
 *
 *    URI           = scheme ":" heir-part [ "?" query ] [ "#" fragment ]
 *
 *  We will support however something intbetween an URI and an IRI in that we'll
 *  all UTF-8 rather than limit certain characters to ASCII.
 *
 *  For the NCBI path  URL:  The hier-part is intended to be compatible with the 
 *                    "file:" scheme  Authority on any of the Unix-like operating
 *                    systems must either be empty or "localhost".  For Windows
 *                    it must  be a host that can be used if the "file" url is
 *                    translated into a UNC style Windows path.  Also in a
 *                    Windows vfs: URL a single colon ':' will be allowed only at
 *                    the end of a single character rive letter for the first
 *                    sub-part of the path.
 *
 *    scheme        = "ncbi-file" ; ( case insensitive )
 *
 *    hier-part     = "//" authority path-abempty
 *                  / path-absolute
 *                  / path-relative
 *                  / path-empty
 *
 * by RFC 3986 authority is
 *    authority     = [ userinfo "@" ] host [ ":" port]
 * but at this point we only recognize
 *    authority     = host
 *
 * by RFC 3986 host is
 *    host          = IP-literal / IPv4address / reg-name
 * but at this point we only recognize
 *    host          = reg-name
 *
 *    reg-name      = *( unreserved / pct-encoded / sub-delims )
 *
 *    path          = path-abempty
 *                  / path-absolute
 *                  / path-noscheme
 *                  / path-rootless
 *                  / path-empty
 *
 *    path-abempty  = * ( "/" segment )
 *
 *    path-absolute = "/" segment-nz *( "/" segment )
 *
 *    path-noscheme = segment-nz-nc *( "/" segment )
 *
 *    path-rootless = segment-nz *( "/" segment )
 *
 *    path-empty    = ""
 *
 *    segment       = *pchar       ; can be empty
 *    segment-nz    = 1*pchar      ; can't be empty
 *    segment-nz-nc = 1*pchar-nz   ; can't be empty
 *
 *    pchar         = ":" / pchar-nc
 *
 *    pchar-nc      = unreserved / pct-encoded / sub-delims ? "@"
 *
 *    pct-encoded   = "%" HEXDIG HEXDIG ; hex digits are 0-9, a-f or A-F
 *
 *    authority   = "localhost" / host-name ; the host name is an O/S specific 
 *                                          ; name of a remote host 
 *
 *    query       = query_entry [ * ( "&" query_entry ) ]
 *
 *    query_entry = "encrypt" / "enc" / ( "pwfile=" hier-part ) / ( "pwfd=" fd )
 *
 *    fd          = 1* DIGIT
 *
 *    unreserved  = ALPHA / DIGIT / "-" / "." / "_" / "~" / UTF-8
 *
 *    reserved    = gen-delims / subdelims
 *
 *    gen-delims  = ":" / "/" / "?" / "#" / "[" / "]" / "@"
 *
 *    sub-delims  = "!" / "$" / "&" / "'" / "(" / ")" / "*"
 *                / "+" / "," / ";" / "="
 *
 * Handwaving on the UTF-8.  We'll accept it rather than requiring percent encoding
 * in most cases.

 * Examples:
 *         "ncbi-file://home/my-name/data-files"
 *         "ncbi-file://win-server/archive/secure/read12345?encrypted"
 *         "ncbi-file:///c:/scanned-data/0001/file.sra?enc?pwd-file=c:/Users/JamesMcCoy/ncbi.pwd"
 *
 *  We allow an implied scheme of "vfs" if none present.
 *  'host-name' is partially implemented for Windows.  Not currently for any the
 *  of the supported Unix systems.  We do not support IP addresses instead of 
 *  host names.
 *
 *  'path' can be either absolute or relative and must be posix style as per 
 *  RFC 3986 and matches the "file" scheme.
 *
 *  'fragment' is not yet implemented or defined.
 *
 *  'fd' is a system specific file handle.  Not yet supported on Windows.
 *
 * --------------------
 *
 * VFS posix_path representation:
 *
 * The internal representation of a path for VFS resembles very closely the
 * POSIX pathname crossed with the Windows UNC path.  Only the Unix "/" 
 * separator is allowed not the "\" for paths.
 *
 * posix-path     = full-path / relative-path
 *
 * full-path      = ["//" host] "/" [ directory-path "/" ] resource
 *
 * relative-path  = [ directory-path "/" ] resource
 *
 * directory-path = resource [ "/" directory-path ]
 *
 * resource       = string ; (UTF-8 O/S specific name for a directory or a file)
 *
 * host           = string ; (UTF-8 O/S specific name for the local or remote host)
 *
 * For a host "localhost" is a synonym for the current host.
 * The "//host" is not guaranteed to work for all systems except "//localhost"
 *
 * The resource "." is assumed to mean the local directory and will be stripped
 * when a path is made canonical.
 *
 * The resource ".." is assumed to mean the containing directory and when made 
 * canonical it will be left in at the begining for relative paths or removed along 
 * with the preceding resource name.
 *
 * For Windows the device is handled in a unique way with some potential for ambiguity.
 * The UNC approach for a named drive "C:" becomes "/c".  So "C:\" becomes "/c/".
 *
 * In the future the complex approach from the "file:" URL should be adopted 
 * with the ":" allowed only in the first directory name in a path.  RFC 3986 
 * notes though that this complex approach puts some five variants into the ABNF
 * to describe the path portion of an URL.
